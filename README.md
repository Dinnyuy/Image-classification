# Image Classification and Object Localization with CNN

## Overview
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification and object localization. The model classifies images into predefined categories and draws bounding boxes around localized objects within the images.

## Problem Statement
Develop a CNN model to classify images into multiple categories and localize objects within images by drawing bounding boxes around them.

## Approach

1. *Model Architecture*: 
   - A CNN was designed with multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by max-pooling layers for dimensionality reduction.
   - The model was finalized with dense layers for classification output.
  
2. *Data Preprocessing*:
   - Images were resized to 150x150 pixels and normalized to a [0, 1] range using the `ImageDataGenerator` class from TensorFlow.
   - Data was augmented to improve generalization during training.

3. *Object Localization*:
   - Images were divided into regions of interest (ROIs), and the model predicted the class for each region.
   - Bounding boxes were drawn around the detected objects using OpenCV.

4. *Training and Evaluation*:
   - The model was trained for 2 epochs and optimized using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
   - Training accuracy and loss were plotted for performance evaluation.

## Results
- The model successfully classified images into their respective categories and localized objects by drawing bounding boxes around them.
- Accuracy improved over the epochs, and the object localization function correctly annotated regions of interest in images.

## Individual Contribution
- Designed and implemented the CNN architecture and object localization functionality.
- Handled data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Developed the visualization tools to monitor performance and evaluate results.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- *TensorFlow* and *Keras*: For building and training the CNN model.
- *OpenCV*: For image processing, including drawing bounding boxes.
- *Matplotlib*: For plotting training metrics.
- *NumPy*: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
